0. About.
iHelpers is a set of classes designed to help with iOS development, reducing some tasks that would require a large sum of lines of code to just one or two. It was created and is being manteinaned by Eduardo Almeida (MegaEduX.com). Also, keep in mind that this project is still very young, so it still misses a lot of features.

1. How can I use iHelpers?
Just drag the iHelpers group to your Xcode project, and include "iHelpers.h" whenever you want to use any of its classes.

2. What are the iHelpers functions?
-> MEXMultitasking
- (void)setNotificationForDate:(NSDate *)date withString:(NSString *)alertBody withSound:(NSString *)soundName withRepeatInterval:(int)seconds cancellingOtherNotifications:(BOOL)boolean; // Sheducles a local notification.
- (BOOL)longTaskEnabled; // Check if long-task api multitasking is enabled.
- (void)setLongTaskEnabled:(BOOL)status; // Enable or disable long-task multitasking.

-> MEXCracking
+ (BOOL)applicationIsCracked; // Reports if the application is cracked, or not.
- (void)ifCrackedCrashAfterLaunches:(int)appLaunches; // If the application is cracked, it will crash at launch after X launches.
- (void)ifCrackedCrashAfterSeconds:(double)seconds; // If the application is cracked, it will crash after X seconds.

-> MEXAlerts
- (void)displayAlertWithTitle:(NSString *)title message:(NSString *)message delegate:(id)delegate cancelButton:(NSString *)cancelButtonTitle otherButton:(NSString *)otherButtonTitle, ...; // Displays a UIAlertView with options.
- (void)displayActionSheetInView:(UIView *)view style:(UIActionSheetStyle)sheetStyle message:(NSString *)message delegate:(id)delegate cancelButton:(NSString *)cancelButtonTitle destructiveButton:(NSString *)destructiveButtonTitle otherButton:(NSString *)otherButtonTitle, ...; // Displays a UIActionSheet with options.

-> MEXLog (NIGHTLY UNTESTED CLASS)
- (void)logToConsole:(NSString *)string; // Same as NSLog.
- (void)log:(NSString *)string toKey:(NSString *)key; // Logs a string to a user default.
- (void)log:(NSString *)string toFile:(NSString *)filePath replacingContentsOfFile:(BOOL)replace appendingTimestamp:(BOOL)timestamp error:(NSError **)error; // Logs a string to a file with options.
- (NSString *)stringFromFile:(NSString *)filePath error:(NSError **)error; // Turns the contents of a file into an NSString.
- (NSString *)stringFromKey:(NSString *)key; // Turns the contents of a NSUserDefault into a NSString.

-> MEXAV (NIGHTLY UNTESTED CLASS)
- (void)playSoundWithName:(NSString *)fileName type:(NSString *)extension; // Play a sound
- (void)playVideoWithPath:(NSString *)fileName type:(NSString *)extension view:(UIView *)viewToDisplay; // Play a video

-> MEXRandom (WORK IN PROGRESS, BUT WORKING)
+ (int)generateRandomNumberUpTo:(int)number // Generate a random int from 0 to number

3. Can I test iHelpers power before using it?
Sure. Just open the Xcode project, and run it.

4. Do I need something special to compile iHelpers?
Nope, just what you normally use to develop for iOS (Latest Xcode with iOS SDK).

5. Do I need to give any appreciation when using iHelpers?
It would be very appreciated, but I can't force anyone to. If you don't want to give appreciation on your application I'd appreciate you at least donated.

6. Does this work on the Mac OS X SDK?
This was made with the iOS SDK in mind, so even though some classes may work, they are completely unsupported.
