**0. About.**

iHelpers is a set of classes designed to help with iOS development, reducing some tasks that would require a large sum of lines of code to just one or two. It was created and is being manteinaned by Eduardo Almeida (MegaEduX.com). Also, keep in mind that this project is still very young, so it still misses a lot of features.

**1. How can I use iHelpers?**

Just drag the iHelpers group to your Xcode project, and include "iHelpers.h" whenever you want to use any of its classes.

**2. What can iHelpers do?**

iHelpers is becoming a bit too big to explain each class. But, well... just check the headers. It's self-explainable. :P

**3. Can I test iHelpers power before using it?**

Sure. Just open the Xcode project, and run it. You will be able to check most of its functions.

**4. Do I need something special to compile iHelpers?**

Nope, just what you normally use to develop for iOS (Xcode with iOS4+ SDK).

**5. Do I need to give any appreciation when using iHelpers?**

It would be very appreciated, but I can't force anyone to. If you don't want to give appreciation on your application I'd appreciate if you donated to my project.

**6. Does this work on the Mac OS X SDK?**

This was made with the iOS SDK in mind, so even though some classes may work (don't get your hopes too high though), they are completely unsupported.
