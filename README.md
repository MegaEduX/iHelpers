**0. About.**

iHelpers is a set of classes designed to help with iOS development, reducing some tasks that would require a large sum of lines of code to just one or two. It was created and is being manteinaned by Eduardo Almeida (MegaEduX.com). Also, keep in mind that this project is still very young, so it still misses a lot of features.

**1. How can I use iHelpers?**

Easy way: Just drag the iHelpers group to your Xcode project, and include "iHelpers.h" whenever you want to use any of its classes.

Best way: Compile libiHelpers and use iHelpers as a library.

**2. What can iHelpers do?**

iHelpers is becoming a bit too big to explain each class. It aims to do everything. It even comes with documentation. Just select the "Documentation" scheme on the iHelpers project. You need appledoc installed in /usr/bin/appledoc to compile it, though. 

**3. Do I need something special to compile iHelpers?**

Nope, just what you normally use to develop for iOS (Xcode with iOS4+ SDK).

**4. Let's talk about licenses...**

iHelpers is distributed with a BSD license.

**5. Does this work on the Mac OS X SDK?**

This was made with the iOS SDK in mind, so even though some classes may work (don't get your hopes too high though), they are completely unsupported.
